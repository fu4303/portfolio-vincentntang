Every year I've written things I did/learned this year, and where I want to move forward for the next year. My previous post is for 2018 is here[2018-into-2019](https://vincentntang.com/). The tradition continues on this year again :)

## I gave X talks

In 2018 I didn't really know that much about software development. Luckily I had great mentors from the open source community, hackathons, and devs locally teach me all sorts of cool things. I'm eternally grateful for their support, so as thanks I wanted to give back to the tech community at large.

When I think back to why I wanted to give talks in the first place, it stems from two reasons. One, it's fun to learn and teach a new concept to someone else (Dylan Israel). Two, you can't grow unless your both learning and mentoring at the same time.

Most of the talks I did revolved around things I found interesting, or learned from side projects or work. Here's the list of talks:

## I started a new job in a new city

I might be a late bloomer here, but I've never really ventured too far from home. I grew up in Orlando, FL and lived there most of my life, supporting my family's business. The first software gig I worked at in Orlando, didn't work out, so I ventured out to other cities. When I had the opportunity to move to Tampa, it was like a dream come true. Life goes on and I could do pretty much whatever I wanted, and the adventures never stop there. There's something fun about not knowing what you'll be doing the next day, or who you'll end up meeting. My free time as of now is spent exploring new hobbies and interests, and I've taken a liking to rock climbing and volleyball. I still haven't fully situated myself in town, so my priorities have shifted away from software development for the time being. I haven't looked at a web tutorial in several months.

## I learned how to do backend development

Everything I've learned up until this point in web development had been in frontend development and design. I wanted to get my feet wet through the door, and it just made more sense to focus on something I could excel at from the get-go. I used to do architectural design so the transition wasn't too bad. User experience is something I very much enjoy, but I've always fancied myself as a backend developer. Because regardless of how pretty an interface looks, unless its built on a strong foundation it can only do so much. 

I've started to write again on this blog about things I learn. Mostly tailored toward backend and database development, but I will still write about frontend development/design. 

## I learned database development

Fullstack developer is frontend, backend, and database development. I never really had a clear grasp of how databases were created in the real world. It wasn't until I wrote my first seeder and migration that everything just *clicked* [TODO- make a blog post on this]. I did spend time reading database design theory books on this topic. Like how database relations work, etc.

But in this current role that I'm at, I got to see a greenfield project go from nothing to pretty much completed in a span of 4 months. I'm happy to say that I contributed a lot to the coding patterns used in this application. 

## I learned several new technologies

## I competed in X hackathons



## 2020 and onwards

So this concludes my review of 2019! There are a few topics that I wish to learn and
