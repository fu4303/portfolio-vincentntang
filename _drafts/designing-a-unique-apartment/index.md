## How to design a unique apartment space

Up until a few months ago, I've never rented my own apartment. The times I have, I was the +1 guy. The good ol' University Days. Everything pre-furnished, and sometimes having roommates you that borrow your milk and leave moldy cereal behind your rice cooker. 

Moving to a small empty apartment has been a unique experience. For one it's exhilirating. You can get this _whole_ space to yourself (for now) and dictate the rules. No more arguing about who cleans the trash, because guess what it's you! Or debating what temperature to set the place at, I for one like it cold. Others beg to differ.

What do you do when you have an empty apartment? Furnish it. But how? With what? How do you create an environment that's cheap, cool and nifty all in one go?

Here's what I've learned from designing my first empty apartment!

## Do your research beforehand

Skip to the next bulletpoint if your at this point and regret the choice you made. My assumption is you didn't own any furniture prior to moving, so everything is a blank slate. Also you don't own a house either.

When I moved to a new city, I couch surfed. Why? I didn't know the area. I lived with parents before to save on money. Owning my own furniture was still new to me too.

You'll find out some areas in town can be rather _gentrified_ and others not as they seem! You should always ask people who live there what it's like there. 

## Determing where the workspace will be

Designing a space reminded me of playing the *Sims*. You play a virtual character, design a virtual house, and figure out how this person will live his life. It's not that far off from here. Except your that person.

When there's an empty space, you need to designate zones.

- Bedroom
- Living Room
- Kitchen/Dining Room

Normally the kitchen and dining room are one entity, but it's not always the case. Generally speaking, you'll also want to define a computer station / work area.

Designating where your work space is going to be takes a bit of figuring out. 
Most standard apartment complexes uses a long rectangular design, so it goes inbetween the living room and kitchen. If you live in a 1.5 living room like the one I do above, it's different. You'll have to split the room into two segments, using a natural room divider. I'll cover more on this in a bit

## Designing focal points

I asked for a lot of feedback when designing my space. One of my designer friends told me about *focal points*.

[TODO - enter meditative image]

say what? Focal points? A place to meditate your thoughts? No it's more than that. 

Imagine if you walk into your friends apartment. What's the first thing that you notice? Is it the pure barren empty room? The rug? The couch? 

Perhaps maybe you walk into a nice hotel instead. You notice the beautiful chandelier in the ceiling. Or you walk in a hole-in-the-wall restaurant, your first point of contact is the cash register.

Maybe you go to a website. www.amazon.com . What's the first thing that catches your mind? It's usual the banner. Same thing.

Whatever it may be, that's a focal point. It's what draws your attention when first going into an entity. 

The most important thing to note is you should only have *one* focal point zone. And it needs to be roughly eye level for most people.

In most apartments, this will be your couch, TV, and any other decor in that area. You generally want this to be 


Up until a few months ago, I've never rented my own apartment as the sole renter. The times I've lived in an apartment, I've been the +1. Those were University Days, and usually came pre-furnished. 

Moving to a small empty apartment has been a unique experience. Even though I used to partially work in interior design, designing my own space has been challenging.
