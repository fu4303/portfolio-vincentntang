👋 I'm Vincent Tang, a web developer and former kitchen designer from Orlando. Currently I work as a fullstack developer at [E2 Generations](https://www.e2gens.com/), and teach at the local coding bootcamp. My work is also found in [DevTo](https://dev.to/vincentntang), [DevPost](https://devpost.com/vincentntang), [Codepen](https://codepen.io/vincentntang), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3258462/vincent-tang) amongst others.

This blog originally started as a way to document things I learn during a career change, but it's since changed. I love trying out new things, and this blog is a reflection of my [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) where I learn in [public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/).
