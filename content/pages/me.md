Iâ€™m Vincent Tang, a web developer, technical writer, and former restaurant architect from Orlando. I currently work as a front end software engineer for [E2 Generations](https://www.e2gens.com/), and I've also written for [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/u/Kagerjay/summary), [MozillaDeveloperNetwork](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/profiles/Kagerjay), [DevTo](https://dev.to/vincentntang), [among others](/publications).

I started this website as a place to document everything I learned while going through a [career change](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-i-made-a-career-change-into-web-development/). I [learn in public](/learn) and write about everything I know.

My goal is to become the best engineer that I can be, through projects that have a lasting impact. I aim to create a beautiful corner of the web free of ads, affiliate links, or sponsored posts.
