Here's my software career story, maybe it'll inspire you to become a software developer too ðŸ˜„

## Elementary Years - Inspiration

[TODO - pic of me in younger years]

3rd grade. I must have been 8 at the time. It was career day. A day in which parents come together to share what they do in the workforce. We had firefighters, teachers, dental assistants, and more to come! But my parents couldn't come - they were always busy working running a small business.

In comes an engineer from NASA. We had a field day learning about how rocket propulsion systems work. He brought in a bottle rocket, and demonstrated it fly. I thought it was the coolest thing ever.

Next summer, I was enrolled into Space Camp at Kennedy Space Center. I don't have any pictures here unfortunately. I remember building my own little toy line finding robot, and being super estatic about the results. Creating something with my own hands and seeing it move was beyong exciting.

I knew I wanted to become an engineer that day forward.

## Middle school years - Game modding

[TODO - PICS - Starcraft]

Fast forward a little bit later. I'm in middle school now. I've developed a pretty unhealthy obsession into gaming. From super nintendo, playstation, and now a computer. My cousin bought a copy of "Starcraft" for my birthday. It's an online video game where you have a base and you need to destroy the other person's base. It's the precursor to modern E-sports.

I started playing competitively around this time. To do this, I learned about algorithms designed around strategy. What was the best move from A to B? It's a bit like real time chess.

There was this mysterious side with this game. People built custom - modded games, *inside the game*!. I thought it was crazy, but being 12 at the time I had lots of free time. I learned about this mysterious thing called scripting, and started to fiddle around my first time game modding. I broke apart how other people wrote maps, and learned to spin off my own video games. Basically horrible renditions of games you'll find in the mobile market today.

## High school years - Learning about the web

[TODO Pics - Me high school]

Around this time, I started to learn how websites work. Mostly because I did forum moderation and wrote gaming wikis to my favorite games. There wasn't much of a guide on how to do this, so it was basically trial and error. What does this `<p>` tag do? Ah okay, you can close this bracket into another. How do `<img>` get added into the site, or how do I format this table?

I worked as a QA tester for NCSoft around this time, and a few other companies. This was all unpaid, but it was like "here's this large overpowered stick, go break things and report back to us". I was a really naiive at the time but this was how I learned about how software was created.

## College years - Lots of wrong career choices

[TODO Pics - subscriber count]

I didn't feel like spending a lot money on a 4 year degree, so I went instate at Univeristy of Florida. Never did plan out what kind of engineer I wanted to be. Whatever sounded the most interesting in my intro to engineering class was what I chose. Material Science.

After working a few years in research labs, I realized that slow-paced environments weren't for me. I spent 100+ hours writing my dissertation on a theoretical subject that I didn't feel that much passion towards.

My last year of school sucked. My internship fell through, but I worked as a Resident Assistant that summer instead and ended up getting laid off. I decided to double down and work at an engineering CO-OP plus do my thesis at the same time. Bad idea, it was even more stressful.

Burnt out I decided to do something I always wanted to do - start a youtube gaming channel [TODO - link]. At it's peak it reached 4000 subscribers and 400k views. That's not a lot by today's standards, but back in 2013 it was a big deal to me. I had written guides read by 1/2 million people and translated in multiple languages by fans.

I like to think back on one memorable comment I read - and it still sticks to me today. A surgeon from Germany had used my gaming tutorials to learn how to better improve ambidexterity in surgeries. It's made me realize that you can cause lasting positive impact in ways you don't forsee.

After that, I graduated from University. Still didn't know what to do.

## After College - Moving into Software

[TODO Pics Airtable]

Interviewing for jobs was really hard for me. For one I sucked at it. The question of "What are you most proud of?" always got me. It was inspiring a surgeon in Germany to practice with video games. The thing is ... it's not treated seriously. I learned about it the hard way. 

I failed every interview after that. I never reflected on anything I did or accomplished at school. It was too hard to put in words.

I ended up just working for family instead, designing restaurant kitchens. I rarely tell anyone I work for family - it's not something I'm particularly proud of. I didn't create that legacy, and didn't choose that lifestyle for half my life growing up. it always felt like it undermined everything I strived to achieve for.

I designed kitchens for 6 years of my life. I got to work with some famous chefs, helped design a restaurant that hit national news, amongst other highlights. I learned a lot through self-education.

As my responsibilities kept piling on, I found myself constantly unable to keep up with the workload. Sometimes a client needed a CAD file, another needed attention on a broken shipment, another didn't speak English. I had a hard time juggling all of these tasks at any given time, so I needed to get better at managing, delegating, and automating tasks.

I started to explore tools online, and just found a really excel-like spreadsheet tool called Airtable. I wrote my first plugin - a programming script in excelVBA - that downloaded images from their server to my local PC (TODO - see here)

It got used by 1000+ people, and still gets feature requests today. That dopamine hit reminded me much of my time running a gaming youtube channel. I never explored programming deeply and always regretted it.

## My First Job

[TODO Me talking at Canvas SVG]

From then on, I wanted to work in software. I decided that my first job would be a frontend developer role - because my background in kitchen design and helping businesses thrive go hand in hand.

At this point forward, my goal was to become the best software engineer I could be. I asked myself "What would this person be doing to get there?". Attending tech conferences, speak at meetups, compete in hackathons, write tech documentation for mozilla, participate in developer cohorts, write curriculum content for freecodecamp, and more. So I did.

When I felt confident, I applied to my first job. Actually many jobs. I got rejected more times than I can count, but luckily one employer took a chance on me. Even though I had less experience than a dozen other candidates for this same role, he took me in. Some employers look at how fast you ramp up instead of years of experience.

I had the opportunity to design construction software for the aquatics industry. Probably the coolest thing ever. Walking into the office and seeing large 3D assembly designs just made me so excited to be in there everyday.

I learned how git, APIs, and frontend/backend systems work amongst other things.

## My Second Job

[PICS - Housewarming]

The first job didn't work out mostly because I've never worked in a formal team setting, and had a lack of experience. Coming from a background where all I did was delegate and manage to purely working in IC (individual contributor) was a difficult transition. Old habits die hard. I've learned my mistakes from this and moved on.

I didn't want to work in my hometown anymore, and decided to go venture out to another city. Moved to my first empty apartment (TODO - post soon) and have loved it since

## What the future holds

[PICS - Dunno]

I've come to appreciate where I am right now. I suffered from burn out a few times already, mostly because I never was good at planning long term. I don't considered myself a programmer, but rather a problem solver and a content creator. I want to explore this whole other realm in the tech world - hardware development, gaming engines, devops, and more computer-sciency things. And make educational/entertaining content from it, something that inspires the next generation of problem solvers.

My 3 - 5 year goal is to become a creative interactive developer. Someone who creates experiences, or builds tools that tells stories. This means mastery in a few different fields, namely in 3D development, design, and animation - none of which I'm really great at. So for this, I'm pursuing interests in game and hardware development.
