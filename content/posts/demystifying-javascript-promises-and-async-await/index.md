You dig through the web, looking for an explaination of how javascript promises and async/await work. Maybe you stumble upon videos such as funfunfunction that break it down conceptually. Or a stackoverflow post with live examples showing how it works. 

The concept still doesn't stick though - you need an analogy to pull it all together. You're not alone in this, I've struggled for the longest time understanding Javascript promises and async/await.

I've come up with an analogy that has finally clicked it to me, and my hope is it will be the same for you

## How does it work?

Let's step back away from Javascript land for one moment. Heck, let's go away from webdevelopment in general. Bear with me for a moment while I talk about a completely unrelated topic to build the analogy:

FIREWORKS

You've seen them on New Year's, and if you're American possibly on July 4th as well. These dazzling spectacles adorn the night sky with shining fervor, into a night show that's hard to forget.

A fireworks show is comprised of many types of fireworks. The most common one is an aerial shell, which looks like this:

Let's first talk about how a firework gets launched into the air first. If you grew up when Coyote and Roadrunner was a thing, you may have seen cartoons like this:

(show gif of Coyote getting blown up on fuse)

Fireworks use a fuse system, where an ignition source is needed to light the rope. We can break down the steps from start to finish, of how an operator launches a firework:

1. Take a heat source
2. Light up the rope
3. Wait for rope to extend
4. Watch the firework launch

Javascript promises are no different. Here's an example of code to illustrate that same workflow:

```
put code here, with promise then
